# WhereAreYou
Do You want your phone to be located without your any action?  You will have a sound and vibrated notification if someone is locating you.  WhereAreYou will open the GPS, find your cordinate, and send to only who locate you.  You don't have to answer the request.  Thus if you are in a loud street, phone in the backpack, and you don't know your friend or familly are looking for you, you can still let them know where your are.

Of course, you can block the request.  Stranger's request is also blocked.  A request of known people can be block by uncheck the allow button before he send the request.

The WhereAreYou don't eat your power all the time.  It only work when someone is looking for you.  And if you are indoor and the gps not work, it shutdown after 5mins.

You have to connect the internet to let WhereAreYou work.

When locating is done, your friend can have the cordinate of your position.  The google map will open the location for you.
